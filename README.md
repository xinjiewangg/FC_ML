# FC_ML
# "RF" refers to "Random Forest"
# "2_RF_identify.py" is used for categorizing microplastics and natural particle types from multiparametric flow cytometry data, as well calcualted performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision) and the balanced accuracy. It also contains the training of scaler and classifier for different cases.
# "2_RF_quantify.py" is used to quantify microplastics in mixture samples. The scaler and classifier for each case are trained seperately by running "2_RF_identify.py" 
# Code for other supervised learning models are available upon request.
